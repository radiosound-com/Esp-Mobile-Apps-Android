Based on https://github.com/JoaoLopesF/Esp-Mobile-Apps-Android

# Changes

Added support for controlling which URL the ESP32 uses for a firmware upgrade by scanning a special QR code

(Currently hardcoded to *bleenky.apps.radiosound.com - and whether it works/opens the right app will depend on the QR code scanner app used.)
